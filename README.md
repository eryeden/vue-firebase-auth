# vue-firebase-auth
This repository is the next phase of web app prototyping, where I will develop a web application using Vue.js and Firebase authentication.
The application will encompass the following features:
- The system will include these pages:
  - Top page
  - Registration page
  - Login page
  - User-specific page
- The application will support user registration.
- Upon a login attempt, the system identifies and authenticates the user.
- If a user is already registered, they will be redirected to the personalized dashboard.
